# Nylas Rust SDK Rocket Demo

ðŸš€This project is a demo of using the Nylas Rust SDK with the Rocket web framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

ðŸ”§ Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Rust installed on your system.

### Installation

This project includes a `Makefile` to simplify the installation process. Ensure that you have the `make` utility available on your system.

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nylas.git
   cd nylas/examples/rocket
   ```

1. Install the crate and all required core dependencies:

   ```shell
   make install
   ```

   If the `.env` file doesn't exist, this command creates it by copying from `.env.example`. This command also builds the project.

1. **Visit the Nylas Website:** Go to the official Nylas website at [https://dashboard.nylas.com/sign-in](https://dashboard.nylas.com/sign-in) to create a Nylas account if you don't already have one.

1. **Registration Process:** Complete the registration process by filling in the necessary information.

Now that you have your Nylas project set up, you need to set the Client ID, and Client Secret in your application:

1. **Set the Nylas Client ID, and Client Secret:** Open your project's configuration file or `.env` file, where you store environment variables.

1. **Add the Nylas Client ID , Client Secret, and System Token:** In your configuration file, add the following environment variables, replacing `<Nylas_Client_ID>`, and `<Nylas_Client_Secret>`, with the actual values you obtained from the Nylas dashboard:
     ```yaml
     # Nylas
     NYLAS_CLIENT_ID=<Your_Nylas_Client_ID>
     NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your_Nylas_Client_Secret>
     ```
     - Save the changes to your configuration file.

1. Run the server locally:

   ```shell
   make run
   ```

## Usage

ðŸš€ To use this project, follow the installation steps and then run the server locally.
